# GDG on Campus Application - Technical Assessment

## Brief Description of the Local Problem You're Solving

**Problem**: Traditional educational institutions struggle with personalized learning experiences that adapt to individual student needs, learning patterns, and career aspirations. Students often receive generic, one-size-fits-all educational content that doesn't consider their unique backgrounds, goals, or learning preferences. This leads to:

- High dropout rates in technical education programs
- Students feeling overwhelmed or under-challenged
- Lack of personalized career guidance and mentorship
- Difficulty tracking individual learning progress and adapting content accordingly
- Limited integration of modern AI technologies in educational workflows

**Local Context**: This problem is particularly acute in college campuses where students come from diverse backgrounds but receive standardized course materials and guidance, leading to suboptimal learning outcomes and career preparation.
